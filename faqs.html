        <li class="faq-qa">
          <h3>Q: How much does it cost to commission a painting?</h3>
          <p class="a">A: Commissions start at £300 for A5 size, £500 for A4 and £750 for A3 (all unframed). Final pricing depends on subjects and complexity. If you have any concerns or questions don’t hesitate to 
            <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> and I’ll be happy to provide a quote for the painting you have in mind.
        </li>
      
        <li class="faq-qa">
          <h3>Q: What sizes and options do you offer?</h3>
          <p class="a">A: Standard sizes are A5, A4 and A3. Custom sizes (and shapes) are often available on request. I typically work on canvas or canvas board.</p>
        </li>

        <li class="faq-qa">
            <h3>Q: How long does a commission take?</h3>
            <p class="a">A: Approximately 4–6 weeks for an A5 oil painting and 6–8 weeks for A4 or A3, depending on complexity, current queue and drying time.</p>
          </li>
      
        <li class="faq-qa">
          <h3>Q: How far in advance should I order a commission for a birthday/christmas present?</h3>
          <p class="a">A: I recommend ordering well in advance of any deadline. If you are looking to commission an oil painting in time for Christmas, please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> by 3rd of November 2025 at the latest and bear in mind that commissions are limited and arranged on a first come first served basis. That said, occasionally I am able to accommodate rush orders so do feel free to reach out, and I’ll always try my best to see what I can do.</p>
        </li>
      
        <li class="faq-qa">
          <h3>Q: How do I commission a painting? What is the process?</h3>
          <p class="a">A: First, get in touch via the commission request form to discuss your idea. We’ll talk about the subject, size, and any reference photos. Once we agree on details and pricing, a 10% deposit is required to confirm the commission. I will then create the painting (with updates along the way), and upon completion I’ll send you a photo of the finished piece. The remaining balance is paid, and then the artwork is delivered to you or you are welcome to pick it up yourself if you live locally.</p>
        </li>
      
        <li class="faq-qa">
          <h3>Q: Do I need to pay a deposit? What are the payment terms?</h3>
          <p class="a">A: Yes - a 10% deposit secures your slot. The balance is due after you approve the final painting, before delivery.</p>
        </li>
      
        <li class="faq-qa">
          <h3>Q: Do you work from photos or do I need to sit?</h3>
          <p class="a">A: I work from your photographs, so no in-person sitting is required. Clear, well-lit images yield the best results.</p>
        </li>
      
        <li class="faq-qa">
          <h3>Q: What kind of photo should I provide?</h3>
          <p class="a">A: The subject’s face should be clear (not blurry!), the photo should represent the desired pose or expression, and good lighting/color always helps. Send multiple photos if you're unsure, so we can discuss which would translate best into a painting. The better the photo, the better the painting!</p>
        </li>
      
        <li class="faq-qa">
          <h3>Q: Do the portraits come framed?</h3>
          <p class="a">A: Paintings are supplied unframed, so you have the freedom to frame them to your taste.</p>
        </li>
      
        <li class="faq-qa">
          <h3>Q: How will I receive the painting? Do you ship UK-wide?</h3>
          <p class="a">A: The painting will either be shipped to you or if you’re based near London you are welcome to come and pick it up in person. At the moment I do not ship internationally; I accept commissions from UK-based customers only.</p>
        </li>
      
        <li class="faq-qa">
          <h3>Q: I need a painting urgently - can you do a rush order?</h3>
          <p class="a">A: Yes - sometimes. Standard timelines are 4–8 weeks, however, if you have a tight deadline, contact me. I may be able to accommodate a rush order depending on my schedule.</p>
        </li>
      
        <li class="faq-qa">
          <h3>Q: Will I see the painting before it’s delivered?</h3>
          <p class="a">A: Yes, I can email you a progress photo or two as I work on your piece. Once it’s finished, I will send photos of the final painting for your approval before shipping.</p>
        </li>
      
        <li class="faq-qa">
          <h3>Q: What if I’m not happy with the finished painting?</h3>
          <p class="a">A: I take a lot of care to make sure every portrait meets a high standard. We’ll agree on the perfect photo before I start painting, so you’ll already have a clear idea of what the final piece will look like. If you love the reference image, you’ll love the painting.</p>
        </li>
      
        <li class="faq-qa">
          <h3>Q: Do you do other types of commissions?</h3>
          <p class="a">A: I specialise in portraits. If you’re looking for pet portraits, landscapes or other subjects, feel free to ask – I take those on selectively.</p>
